# Contributing to JavaParser

Thank you for your interest in helping this project grow!
Here are some general guidelines to follow when contributing to JavaParser:

- Please file an issue before submitting a PR, and reference the issue from your PR.
  The issue should clearly outline the problem or feature request, what benefits it provides, etc.
- When beginning work, it is recommended that you fork the repo, make sure you pull latest `master`,
  create a branch for the issue (i.e. `issue/123`), and submit the PR from this branch.
  This will allow you to work on multiple issues at the same time in parallel, if needed.
  Also note that your PR might not get approved and merged, in which case this avoids you having to
  rebuild or force-push your master branch to reset it.
- Please avoid large PRs with many files changed as much as possible. The smaller the PR, the quicker
  it will be approved and merged.
- For suggested code cleanups or refactorings, please submit an issue and do not begin work until
  approved by a project maintainer. This is to help you avoid possible wasted time or rejected PRs.
  In many cases, it is more convenient for a project maintainer to do the cleanup or refactoring
  themselves than have to review a large PR with many files changed.
- Diff patches are not accepted; please use Pull Requests in GitHub instead. This allows us to
  validate the PR merges and builds successfully, lets us and others review the code more easily,
  and it gives you commit credit once it is merged.
